/**
 * A `spec.UComplex` represents the union of JS types that can be used to describe a complex value,
 * or the absence of one.
 *
 * Like with all other value types, complex values can be described using the general **object form**.
 * The _object form_ conforms to {@link pentaho.type.spec.IComplex}.
 *
 * Complex values support an additional form of value specification, the **array form**:
 * an array of {@link pentaho.type.spec.UInstance},
 * each the specification of the value of one of a complex's properties,
 * in property definition order,
 * according to [Property.Type#index]{@link pentaho.type.Property.Type#index}.
 *
 * Take the following _object form_ example:
 *
 * ```js
 * {
 *   product: "boeing-737",
 *   price:   1500
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Assuming that the two properties were defined in the order `"product"` then `"price"`,
 * it could be written in _array form_, like this:
 *
 * ```js
 * ["boeing-737", 1500]
 * ```
 *
 * However, note that _array form_ can only be used if
 * the [inline type]{@link pentaho.type.spec.IInstance#_} property can, in fact, be omitted.
 *
 * When a complex value is absent, it can be described with a {@link Nully} JavaScript value:
 *
 * ```js
 * null
 * ```
 *
 * @typedef {pentaho.type.spec.IComplex|Array.<pentaho.type.spec.UInstance>|Nully} pentaho.type.spec.UComplex
